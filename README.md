# GenAI_UX_Research_Enabler

This project initiates the development of a multi-agent AI system designed to automate UX research workflows. 

It demonstrates how generative AI can extract and structure user insights from interview data, laying the groundwork for specialized agents to support tasks such as persona creation and journey mapping. 

This work is part of the [**Google Gen AI Capstone project for the 2025 Q1 cohort**](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-generative-ai-intensive_2025q1/home).

By demonstrating four core Gen AI capabilities, it showcases the potential to provide more depth and valuable nuances to UX teams when extracting and synthesizing user insights.

**UX use case being addressed:** extracting insights from in-depth user interviews, persona profiles, and potential ideas for value propositions and MVPs of rural coliving services to be tested in further phases.

**Key Gen AI Capabilities included:**

* **1. Prompt Engineering (including some specific techniques such as Zero-Shot or Few-Shot):** This is fundamental to guiding any LLM and directly relates to how we would instruct UX-AI agents. I will demonstrate the ability to craft effective prompts for UX-related tasks like identifying pain points or summarizing feedback.

* **2. Document Understanding:** Given the initial UX research focus of a UX-AI multi-agent system, this capability is highly relevant. I explore how a Gen AI model can process and extract meaningful information from textual UX data derived from in-depth interview notes.

* **3. Gen AI Evaluation:** Based on my own UX research and design expertise, I have evaluated the appropriateness of the UX research outputs by adjusting parameters like temperature and top_p. Additionally, I outline potential next steps for advanced UX research output evaluation.

* **4. Structured Output/JSON Mode:** This is crucial for organizing extracted UX insights in a usable format and standardizing input-output structures throughout the UX process, mimicking how UX-AI agents might exchange or process information.

These capabilities are demonstrated through the task of extracting insights from user interview notes to inform the design of rural coliving services. This forms a foundational step toward a broader, more advanced UX multi-agent system.

To support this, I have developed a first version of the **"Data Analysis & Synthesis Agent"**, focused on gathering the following key UX insights from in-depth interview raw notes:

* hidden_personality_traits  
* main_motivations  
* main_fears  
* main_stoppers
