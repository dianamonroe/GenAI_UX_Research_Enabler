Prompt Engineering (including some specific techniques such as Zero-Shot or Few-Shot):** This is fundamental to guiding any LLM and directly relates to how we would instruct UX-AI agents. I will demonstrate the ability to craft effective prompts for UX-related tasks like identifying pain points or summarizing feedback.\n\n* **2. Document Understanding:** Given the initial UX research focus of a UX-AI multi-agent system, this capability is highly relevant. I explore how a Gen AI model can process and extract meaningful information from textual UX data derived from in-depth interview notes.\n\n* **3. Gen AI Evaluation:** Based on my own UX research and design expertise, I have evaluated the appropriateness of the UX research outputs by adjusting parameters like temperature and top_p. Additionally, I outline potential next steps for advanced UX research output evaluation.\n\n* **4. Structured Output/JSON Mode:** This is crucial for organizing extracted UX insights in a usable format and standardizing input-output structures throughout the UX process, mimicking how UX-AI agents might exchange or process information.\n\nThese capabilities are demonstrated through the task of extracting insights from user interview notes to inform the design of rural coliving services. This forms a foundational step toward a broader, more advanced UX multi-agent system.\n\nTo support this, I have developed a first version of the **\"Data Analysis & Synthesis Agent\"**, focused on gathering the following key UX insights from in-depth interview raw notes:\n\n* hidden_personality_traits  \n* main_motivations  \n* main_fears  \n* main_stoppers  \n* persona_type","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setting Up\n\n### Install the SDK","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U -q \"google-genai==1.7.0\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T05:11:24.024007Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T05:11:24.024496Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T05:11:30.310105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T05:11:24.024464Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T05:11:30.309115Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m144.7/144.7 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m6.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m100.9/100.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25h","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML, Markdown, display","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T05:11:30.312740Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T05:11:30.313050Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T05:11:31.922336Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T05:11:30.313024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T05:11:31.921656Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google.api_core import retry\n\n\nis_retriable = lambda e: (isinstance(e, genai.errors.APIError) and e.code in {429, 503})\n\ngenai.models.Models.generate_content = retry.Retry(\n    predicate=is_retriable)(genai.models.Models.generate_content)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T05:11:31.923090Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T05:11:31.923444Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.310054Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T05:11:31.923424Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.309231Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\nGOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.310843Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.311229Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.506227Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.311209Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.505486Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1) Prompt Engineering: \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Run a first prompt\n\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\nuser_secrets = UserSecretsClient()\nsecret_value_0 = user_secrets.get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.507193Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.507482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.718992Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.507458Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.718185Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setting up the UX workflow context\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"client = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    contents=\"Extract and analyse the main motivations, stoppers and patterns of the notes of this in-depth interview, find the key patterns to further go on with the 'customer development' process after the etnographic research of a Lean UX process to define and test rural coliving services addressed to city escapee professionals: .\")\n\nprint(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.719954Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.720247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T05:11:44.715746Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T05:11:32.720222Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T05:11:44.714983Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Okay, let's break down how to approach this analysis and define the next steps for your customer development process. Since you haven't provided the interview notes, I'll give you a framework for how to analyze hypothetical notes and then outline general patterns you *might* find, along with what to do with them.\n\n**I. Analyzing Interview Notes: A Framework**\n\n1. **Organization is key:** If your notes are a mess, clean them up.  Use a spreadsheet, a document with clear headings, or a dedicated qualitative analysis tool (like Dovetail, Delighted, or even just tags in a note-taking app).  Organize each interview separately.\n\n2. **Identify the Three Core Elements:** For *each* interview, carefully read and extract:\n    *   **Motivations:**  What are the *driving forces* pushing them to consider rural coliving?  What are they *hoping to achieve*? (e.g., reduced stress, connection to nature, more affordable living, escape the city grind, pursue a passion, find community, etc.)  Look for the *positive* aspects they're seeking.\n    *   **Stoppers (Pain Points/Concerns):** What are the *obstacles* preventing them from immediately making the leap?  What are their *fears* or *doubts*? (e.g., internet connectivity, lack of social life, concerns about safety, difficulty finding work, missing city amenities, concerns about fitting in, financial risks, etc.)  Look for the *negative* aspects they want to avoid.\n    *   **Patterns:** What existing routines, preferences, and habits do they have? What solutions are they using now, and what are their frustrations with their current setup?\n\n3. **Code and Categorize:** As you extract motivations, stoppers, and patterns, assign *codes* or *categories* to them.  For example:\n\n    *   **Motivations:**\n        *   `Nature_Seeking`\n        *   `Stress_Reduction`\n        *   `Community_Building`\n        *   `Affordability`\n        *   `Creative_Pursuit`\n        *   `Work_Life_Balance`\n\n    *   **Stoppers:**\n        *   `Connectivity_Issues`\n        *   `Isolation_Concerns`\n        *   `Job_Security`\n        *   `Amenity_Deficit`\n        *   `Financial_Risk`\n        *   `Social_Fit`\n\n    *   **Patterns:**\n        *   `Remote_Work_Habits`\n        *   `Social_Activity_Frequency`\n        *   `Tech_Dependence`\n        *   `Home_Cooking_Frequency`\n        *   `Outdoor_Activity_Preferences`\n\n4. **Quantify (Lightly):** Count how many times each code/category appears across *all* interviews. This isn't about statistical significance; it's about identifying *prevalence*. Which motivations are most common? Which stoppers are the biggest hurdles?  Which patterns are most frequently seen?\n\n5. **Look for Intersections:** Are there relationships between motivations and stoppers? For example:\n\n    *   Someone highly motivated by `Community_Building` might be *especially* concerned about `Isolation_Concerns`.\n    *   Someone driven by `Creative_Pursuit` might be particularly sensitive to `Connectivity_Issues`.\n\n**II. Hypothetical Patterns & Analysis (Examples)**\n\nLet's imagine some patterns that *might* emerge from your interviews:\n\n*   **Pattern 1: The \"Burned-Out Tech Worker\"**\n    *   **Motivations:** High `Stress_Reduction`, `Nature_Seeking`, `Work_Life_Balance`.\n    *   **Stoppers:** Strong `Connectivity_Issues`, moderate `Job_Security`, some `Isolation_Concerns`.\n    *   **Patterns:** Heavy `Remote_Work_Habits`, high `Tech_Dependence`, low `Outdoor_Activity_Preferences` (currently, but *desire* for more).\n    *   **Analysis:**  This persona is desperate for a change but needs reassurance that they can maintain their income and stay connected.  Connectivity is a *deal-breaker*.  Community is important, but they might be introverted and need a gentle on-ramp.\n\n*   **Pattern 2: The \"Creative Nomad\"**\n    *   **Motivations:** High `Creative_Pursuit`, `Community_Building`, `Affordability`.\n    *   **Stoppers:** Moderate `Financial_Risk`, some `Amenity_Deficit`.\n    *   **Patterns:** Moderate `Remote_Work_Habits` (freelance or project-based), high `Social_Activity_Frequency`, moderate `Tech_Dependence`, high `Home_Cooking_Frequency`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This persona is more flexible and adventurous. They're driven by passion and connection.  Affordability is key. They're willing to sacrifice some amenities for the right community and environment, but they need to feel financially secure.\n\n*   **Pattern 3: The \"Family Escapee\"**\n    *   **Motivations:** High `Nature_Seeking`, `Stress_Reduction`, desire for better education/environment for children.\n    *   **Stoppers:** High `Amenity_Deficit` (schools, healthcare), strong `Job_Security` (or partner's job), `Financial_Risk` (moving costs, selling a house).\n    *   **Patterns:** Varying `Remote_Work_Habits`, family-oriented `Social_Activity_Frequency`, high need for reliable services.\n    *   **Analysis:** This persona has the most complex needs.  They're not just thinking about themselves; they're considering their family's well-being.  They need to be convinced that the rural location offers a *better* quality of life for their children.\n\n**III. Customer Development Next Steps**\n\nBased on your analysis of motivations, stoppers, and patterns, here's how to proceed with customer development:\n\n1.  **Develop Hypotheses about Value Propositions:** For *each* emerging persona/pattern, create a clear hypothesis about what value proposition will resonate most strongly.  Focus on how your coliving service *directly* addresses their motivations *while* mitigating their stoppers.\n\n    *   Example (for the \"Burned-Out Tech Worker\"): \"We believe that a rural coliving space with guaranteed high-speed internet, co-working facilities, and optional social activities will attract burned-out tech workers seeking a less stressful lifestyle.\"\n\n2.  **Create Targeted Prototypes/Mockups:** Don't build the entire coliving space! Create *targeted* prototypes that test your key value propositions. This could include:\n\n    *   **Landing Page:**  Focus on the benefits most relevant to each persona.  A/B test different headlines and imagery.  (e.g., \"Escape the City: Coliving for Tech Professionals\" vs. \"Reconnect with Nature: Your Rural Retreat\").\n    *   **Virtual Tour:** Showcase the features that address specific stoppers.  (e.g., emphasize the dedicated co-working space and internet speeds for the \"Burned-Out Tech Worker\").\n    *   **Community Forum Mockup:**  Gauge interest in specific activities and events.\n    *   **Pricing Plans:** Test different pricing models and options (e.g., flexible short-term stays, all-inclusive packages).\n    *   **\"Magic Demo\" Video:** Create a short video that *shows* how the coliving space solves a specific problem for a particular persona.\n\n3.  **Run Focused Experiments:** Design experiments to test your hypotheses.  Here are some ideas:\n\n    *   **Landing Page A/B Testing:** Drive traffic to different landing pages (targeted at specific personas) and measure conversion rates (e.g., inquiries, sign-ups for more information).\n    *   **\"Would You Pay For This?\" Test:**  Present your prototype (e.g., pricing plan) to potential customers and ask them how likely they would be to pay for it.\n    *   **Concierge MVP:**  Manually provide some of the services you envision (e.g., arrange a trial day of co-working and social activities for a small group) to get direct feedback.\n    *   **Pre-Sale:**  Offer a limited number of discounted \"early bird\" memberships to gauge demand.\n\n4.  **Iterate Based on Feedback:**  *This is the most important step.*  Continuously gather feedback from your experiments and use it to refine your value propositions, prototypes, and ultimately, your coliving service.\n\n**Specific Questions to Guide Iteration:**\n\n*   What aspects of the coliving service are most appealing?\n*   What are the biggest remaining concerns or hesitations?\n*   What could be improved to make the service more attractive?\n*   What features or amenities are missing?\n*   What is the ideal price point?\n\n**Key Considerations for Rural Coliving:**\n\n*   **Connectivity is King:**  Rural areas often have unreliable internet.  This is *the* most common stopper.  Invest in robust internet infrastructure and make it a core selling point.\n*   **Transportation:** How will people get around?  Consider offering shuttle services, bike rentals, or partnerships with local transportation providers.\n*   **Local Integration:**  How will you help residents connect with the local community?  Facilitate interactions with local businesses and organizations.\n*   **Sustainability:**  Emphasize the environmental benefits of rural living.  Consider implementing sustainable practices in the coliving space.\n\nBy following this framework, you can move from ethnographic research to a data-driven customer development process, ensuring that your rural coliving service meets the needs of your target audience. Remember to be flexible and willing to adapt your plans based on what you learn.

Building a multi-agent system for UX research is exciting. Focusing on free, open-source LLMs for an experimental project is a wise approach.\n\nHere's a breakdown of my recommendations, focusing on both Gemini family (where available in open source) and other suitable open-source alternatives, broken down by potential UX role and task:\n\n**Understanding the UX Workflow and Roles**\n\nFirst, let's briefly define the UX roles you might be automating:\n\n*   **UX Researcher:** Conducts user interviews, surveys, usability testing, and analyzes data.\n*   **Interaction Designer:** Creates wireframes, prototypes, and specifies interactions.\n*   **Visual Designer:** Focuses on aesthetics, branding, and the visual interface.\n*   **UX Writer:** Crafts clear and concise copy for the user interface.\n*   **Information Architect:** Organizes content and navigation.\n\n**Recommended LLMs by UX Role & Task (Open Source Focus)**\n\nI'm going to focus on *capabilities* more than specific role titles, because one agent might perform multiple tasks. Note that Google is actively involved in open-source projects, but a *fully* open-source Gemini model isn't readily available yet. We'll focus on alternatives with similar capabilities:\n\n**1. Understanding Requirements & User Needs (UX Researcher - Initial Phase)**\n\n*   **Tasks:** Analyzing research briefs, summarizing existing research, generating interview questions, identifying key user personas.\n*   **Open Source LLMs:**\n    *   **Mistral 7B/8x7B:** This is a powerful and relatively small model. Good for generating creative text, handling conversations, and summarizing documents.  Excellent for question generation and summarizing existing research. You can fine-tune it on UX-specific data for even better performance.\n    *   **Llama 2 (7B, 13B, 70B) / Llama 3 (8B, 70B):** Meta's Llama models are strong performers. Llama 3 is the latest and greatest.The 70B parameter model is excellent, but requires significant resources to run. The 8B model is a good compromise, and may be suitable for summarization, question generation, and basic persona creation.  Llama 2/3 is a great general-purpose model that is well-supported.\n    *   **Falcon:** Falcon is another powerful option. The 7B parameter model is a good starting point.\n    *   **Why these models?** These models are good at understanding context, generating creative content, and handling conversational tasks. They have a good balance of performance and resource requirements. They can be fine-tuned for UX-specific needs.\n*   **Gemini Family Consideration (Indirect):**  While a direct open-source *Gemini* model isn't fully available, consider using its architecture for self-training. You could train a smaller open-source model like Mistral on a dataset built from Gemini's outputs or insights gained from its API. This would be a longer-term project.\n\n**2. Content Creation & Text Refinement (UX Writer, Some Interaction Design)**\n\n*   **Tasks:** Generating UI copy, writing microcopy, creating documentation, refining existing text, writing error messages.\n*   **Open Source LLMs:**\n    *   **Mistral 7B/8x7B (Fine-tuned for Writing):** You could fine-tune Mistral on a corpus of good UX writing examples to improve its ability to generate effective UI copy.\n    *   **Llama 2/3 (Fine-tuned for Writing):**  Similar to Mistral, Llama 2/3 can be fine-tuned on UX writing data.\n    *   **Why these models?** Fine-tuning is key here.  The base models provide a strong foundation, but training them on a specific style of writing (e.g., UX Writing principles) will dramatically improve their output.\n*   **Gemini Family Consideration (Indirect):** Again, no direct open-source Gemini.  Leverage Gemini's content generation capabilities via its API to *generate* a training dataset.  Analyze the outputs of the Gemini API and use them to fine-tune the open-source model you choose.\n\n**3. Task Flow Generation & Information Architecture (Interaction Designer, Information Architect)**\n\n*   **Tasks:**  Generating user flows, suggesting information architecture, outlining website structures, analyzing existing IA.\n*   **Open Source LLMs:**\n    *   **Llama 2/3 (70B):** The 70B parameter models can do a great job because you need the advanced capacity to understand the underlying implications of the system´s desing as whole.\n    *   **Why this model?**  Reasoning and code generation abilities are crucial here. This model are better equipped to handle complex logic and constraints involved in IA and task flow creation.\n*   **Gemini Family Consideration (Indirect):**  If you have access to the Gemini API, test its ability to generate task flows or analyze information architectures.  Use the *structure* and *logic* of its outputs as inspiration (or even as a scaffold) for guiding the open-source model.\n\n**4. Code Generation for Prototyping (Interaction Designer, Frontend Developer)**\n\n*   **Tasks:** Generating HTML/CSS/JavaScript code for prototypes, creating basic interactive elements.\n*   **Open Source LLMs:**\n    *  **CodeLLama 7B / 34B / 70B:** Based on Llama 2, but specifically trained on code. This is an excellent choice for generating code snippets.\n    *   **Why this model?** Specialized code models are *far* better than general-purpose LLMs for code generation. They are trained on massive amounts of code and understand programming syntax and logic.\n\n**5. Summarization & Analysis (All Roles)**\n\n*   **Tasks:** Summarizing user interview transcripts, analyzing survey results, identifying key themes in research data.\n*   **Open Source LLMs:**\n    *   **Mistral 7B/8x7B:** Good for general summarization.\n    *   **Llama 2/3 (13B or 70B):**  Especially strong for summarizing longer documents or complex data.\n    *   **Why these models?** Summarization is a core capability of most LLMs. The larger models generally perform better at extracting the most important information from longer and more complex inputs.\n\n**Key Considerations and Recommendations**\n\n*   **Fine-Tuning is Crucial:**  For *all* of these roles, fine-tuning your chosen LLMs on UX-specific data will dramatically improve their performance.  Collect examples of good UX writing, task flows, research reports, etc., and use them to train your models.\n*   **Embedding Models & Vector Databases:** For analyzing research data, consider using an embedding model (e.g., sentence-transformers, or those integrated into LlamaIndex or Langchain) to create vector embeddings of your data. Store these embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone - the first two are free, the last is commercial). This will allow you to perform semantic search and retrieve relevant information based on meaning, rather than just keyword matching.\n*   **Agent Frameworks (Langchain, LlamaIndex):** Don't try to build your agent system from scratch. Use a framework like Langchain or LlamaIndex. These frameworks provide tools for:\n    *   Connecting LLMs to external data sources (e.g., your research database).\n    *   Defining agent workflows (e.g., first summarize the research, then generate interview questions).\n    *   Giving agents access to tools (e.g., a search engine, a data analysis tool).\n*   **Experimentation is Key:**  This is an experimental project, so don't be afraid to try different models, fine-tuning strategies, and agent configurations.  Track your results and iterate based on what you learn.\n*   **Hardware Requirements:** Be realistic about your hardware. The larger models (e.g., Llama 2 70B) require significant GPU resources to run efficiently.  Consider using cloud-based GPU instances (e.g., Google Colab, AWS SageMaker) if you don't have access to powerful local hardware.\n*   **Licensing:** Always double-check the licenses of the open-source models you choose to ensure they are compatible with your intended use.\n\n**High-Level Architecture Suggestion**\n\n1.  **Data Ingestion & Preparation:** Load your UX research data (transcripts, surveys, etc.) into a structured format.\n2.  **Embedding Generation:** Use an embedding model to create vector embeddings of your data.\n3.  **Vector Database:** Store the embeddings in a vector database.\n4.  **Agent Definition (Langchain/LlamaIndex):** Define your agents, their roles, their tools, and their workflows.  For example:\n    *   *Research Summary Agent:* Uses Llama 2/3 to summarize research documents.\n    *   *Question Generation Agent:* Uses Mistral 7B, fine-tuned on good interview questions, to generate questions.\n    *   *Code Generation Agent:*  Uses CodeLLama to generate prototype code.\n5.  **Orchestration:** Use Langchain/LlamaIndex to orchestrate the interaction between the agents.  For example, the workflow might be:\n    *   User provides a design brief.\n    *   Research Summary Agent summarizes relevant research from the vector database.\n    *   Question Generation Agent generates interview questions.\n    *   Interaction Designer (human) selects the best questions and conducts interviews.\n    *   (And so on...)\n\n**Important Note on Gemini and Open Source**\n\nKeep an eye on Google's open-source efforts. They may release more open-source components or smaller versions of the Gemini models in the future.  If they do, definitely consider incorporating them into your system.\n\nGood luck with your project! I'm happy to answer more specific questions as you progress. Just let me know what you're working on and what challenges you're facing.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"response = chat.send_message(\"Out from all the chat models in Gemini model family,\"\n\"which one would you reccommend me to use if I want to create a Multi AI Agent system\"\n                             \"assisting each one of the UX research profiles involved in\"\n                             \"a UX workflow?

This agent will be responsible for deeply analyzing a .txt file (presumably containing ethnographic data) to extract key insights, fears, blockers, motivations, and patterns related to potential rural co-living services.\n\n**The Challenge and the \"Perfect\" Gemini Model (and Alternatives)**\n\nThe *ideal* scenario would be a Gemini model that:\n\n1.  **Possesses inherent ethnographic knowledge:** Understands research methodologies, cultural context, and ethical considerations.\n2.  **Understands Clinical Psychology Principles:** Can identify underlying psychological drivers, motivations, anxieties, and defense mechanisms in the data.\n3.  **Excel in Text Analysis:** Is adept at identifying themes, patterns, and relationships within large amounts of unstructured text.\n4.  **Is available in a smaller model:** So it´s easier to make inferences\n5. **Free, Opensource and/or with good finetuning resources** So you can start building the agent and performing the data analysis without significant investment in proprietary models or API calls.\n\n**Gemini Family Fit (and Limitations)**\n\nAs mentioned before, there is no fully open-source Gemini model currently available.\n\n**Alternatives & Strategies**\n\nSince we can't directly use a pre-trained open-source Gemini model with this specific profile, we need to construct the agent's capabilities using other open-source tools and techniques:\n\n**1.  Model Selection (Focus on Fine-Tuning Potential):**\n\n*   **Llama 3 (8B):** Llama 3 (8B) is a good middle-ground option. It's powerful enough to handle the complexity of the task, but small enough to be fine-tuned on a reasonable amount of data.\n*   **Mistral 7B/8x7B:** Mistral is another strong contender. It is very performant, and can be fine tuned with minimal effort.\n\n**2.  Knowledge Injection (This is Key!)**\n\nThis is where the \"clinical psychology\" and \"ethnographic research\" background comes into play. We need to explicitly *give* the LLM this knowledge.\n\n*   **Option A:  Fine-Tuning on Ethnographic/Psychological Texts:**  The most effective approach.\n    *   **Gather a dataset:** Collect articles, books, research papers, case studies, and summaries related to ethnographic research methods, clinical psychology principles, and human behavior.\n    *   **Fine-tune:** Fine-tune your chosen LLM on this dataset. The goal is to teach it the specific vocabulary, concepts, and patterns used in these fields.\n*   **Option B: RAG-Based Knowledge Integration (Less Intensive, but Still Important):**\n    *   **Build a Knowledge Base:** Create a database of key ethnographic and psychological concepts, theories, and frameworks.  This could be a text file, a markdown document, or a more structured database.\n    *   **Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  When the agent receives the .txt file for analysis, *first* retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base using techniques like vector similarity search (using embeddings).  Then, combine the retrieved knowledge with the original .txt file and pass this augmented input to the LLM.  This gives the LLM the relevant context it needs to perform the analysis effectively.\n\n**3.  Prompt Engineering**\n\nCraft carefully designed prompts to guide the LLM's analysis:\n\n*   **Clear Instructions:**  \"You are an expert in ethnographic research and clinical psychology. Your task is to analyze the following text to identify the main insights, fears, blockers, motivations, and patterns related to potential rural co-living services.  Pay close attention to the underlying psychological drivers of people's opinions and behaviors.\"\n*   **Specific Questions:**  Instead of just asking the agent to \"analyze the text,\" ask specific questions:\n    *   \"What are the most common fears expressed by the participants?\"\n    *   \"What are the primary motivations for wanting to live in a rural co-living environment?\"\n    *   \"Are there any recurring patterns in the participants' responses that suggest underlying needs or anxieties?\"\n    *   \"Based on your understanding of clinical psychology, what psychological factors might be influencing people's attitudes toward co-living?\"\n*   **Output Format:**  Specify the desired output format (e.g., a bulleted list, a table, a structured report).\n\n**4.  Iterative Refinement & Evaluation**\n\n*   **Analyze & compare the findings:** Perform analysis manually to have the certainty that the findings, blockers, motivations, patterns etc. are consistent among the agent findings and yours.\n*   **Evaluate & Refine:** Carefully evaluate the agent's output.  Does it identify the key insights?  Does it accurately interpret the psychological drivers?  Based on your evaluation, refine your prompts, your knowledge base, or your fine-tuning data.\n\n**Putting it all Together (Example using Langchain)**\n\n```python\nfrom langchain.llms import HuggingFacePipeline\nfrom langchain.embeddings.sentence_transformer import SentenceTransformerEmbeddings\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import Chroma\nfrom langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline\n\n# 1.

Here’s my breakdown of key insights, patterns, fears, motivations, and potential value propositions for a rural coliving MVP service:\n\n**I. Key Insights and Patterns:**\n\n*   **Successful Entrepreneur with Burnout/Re-Evaluation:** Jason's career shows a pattern of entrepreneurial ventures, from music to real food, indicating high drive and achievement orientation. However, the explicit mention of burnout (\"borrachera del fer,\" \"esclavitud del proposito\"), divorce, and a conscious decision to abstain from alcohol/caffeine signal a deep introspection and a desire for a more balanced, meaningful life. This mirrors a common theme in successful individuals seeking coliving spaces: escape from the pressures of the city/conventional success and seeking personal fulfillment.\n\n*   **Community-Oriented, Yet Independent:** He seeks community, referencing his friend in Peru and a potential project with his partner linked to the Amazon. Yet, he dislikes complete sharing, demonstrating a need for a personal space and some level of autonomy. He actively dislikes the 'eco-aldea' approach, or communal assembly type decision making process.\n\n*   **Value Alignment and Authenticity:** He emphasizes \"vendre desde un lloc honest\" (selling from an honest place) and representing people \"que sigui veritat\" (who are truthful) in his current work. This points towards a strong desire for authenticity and values-aligned experiences. He does not believe in the idea of purpose, seeing 'the purpose bandwagons is not truth\". The use of artits being seen as entrepreneurs and 'viceversa' seems like an ideal state he aims for, where people do their business in line with who they really are.\n\n*   **Seeks Nature, Peace, and Creativity:** His expressed desire for a \"Sin ruido, En la naturaleza\" location with \"una habitación cozy de uso individual, decoración xemeneia\" reveals a longing for peace, nature, and a conducive environment for both focused work and relaxation/creativity.\n\n*   **Interested in Exploring New Business Models for Self Growth :** Being solo in a new landscape could make space for a period to build something different around himself (he refers of doing so initially before rolling out the coliving project to more).\n\n**II. Fears and Blockers:**\n\n*   **Loss of Independence:** Concerns about a fully shared/communal living arrangement (like \"eco-aldeas\") indicates a fear of losing personal freedom and autonomy. This fear needs to be actively addressed.\n*   **Misaligned Group Dynamics:** Explicitly concerned about differing levels of extroversion within the community. This highlights the fear of being forced into uncomfortable social situations or having his preferred rhythm disrupted.\n*   **Lack of Meaningful Connection:** Though he desires community, there’s an implied fear of superficial connections or empty \"purpose.\" He seeks deeper connections based on shared values and authenticity.\n*   **Incompatible location choice, given work responsabilities**: There's evidence of willingness in exploring longer remote working solutions, even though some periods can become trickier given specific projects' meetings to fulfill.\n\n**III. Motivations:**\n\n*   **Meaningful Work & Authentic Self:** Finding work/life integration that feels authentic and aligns with his values. He explicitly wishes not to repeat previous burnout behavior of overworking at something lacking 'true' passion or 'being-ness'.\n*   **Creative Inspiration & Personal Growth:** The peace and nature aspect suggest seeking inspiration and a space for introspection/personal growth.\n*   **Genuine Connection & Shared Experience:**  He appears drawn to creating meaningful relationships with like-minded individuals, as opposed to superficial networking.\n*   **Exploring alternative lifestyle** Exploring an alternative lifestyle may empower him to do something differently, based on him not repeating the same working & personal approach like before (in the city context).\n*    **Co-creation approach in community living**: This can represent a true motivational for the individual.\n\n**IV. Value Propositions for MVP Coliving Services:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are 3-4 potential value propositions for coliving MVP services targeting individuals like Jason:\n\n1.  **\"The Bisagra Coliving: Bridge the Gap Between Business & Being.\"** A rural coliving experience designed for experienced entrepreneurs/artists/creative professionals seeking to reconnect with themselves, nature, and meaningful community *without sacrificing autonomy*.  Focused on intentionality, flexible participation, and workshops/peer mentorship related to finding greater life purpose. Features a higher price point based on location excellence. This aligns directly with Jason’s desire to find integration between his artist and entrepreneur self.\n*Unique Offering: Emphasize integration between local rural heroes (arts, craftsmanship etc..) who share values of simple living - create intentional serendipity in connecting co-livers with that particular kind of local talent / individuals.*\n\n2.  **\"The Serene Co-Lab: Unlock Your Creativity in Nature’s Embrace.\"** Offers high-end, private living spaces in nature with shared co-working and social spaces, promoting both focused productivity and restful rejuvenation. Optional curated activities promote connection with the local culture, landscape and gastronomy. Perfect for location-independent professionals.\n*Unique Offering: Private-room guarantees that promote independence but with social-centered and curated spaces designed around co-working themes.*\n\n3. **Personal rural ESCAPE artist.** Customized itineraries based on their work and interests so it provides the best places with accommodation that supports them physically (wifi, office..) and creatively.\n\nThis personal shopper MVP, has these Value props:\n\n  * Find accommodation options that aren't advertised to the general public\n  * Support the community- finding the places to buy what you need as well as services offered to promote sustainability/ local tourism\n  * Planning an \"experience\" and activities around what's important for you on your time there\n  * Find others looking for long-term options like the program is offering for networking!\n\n4.  **\"Coliving Incubator Program: Start doing things in the outside/Rural World.** -\nHelp those that have already obtained financial independence to start an 'slow-incubator program' or 'do something very different for a few weeks'. Support these 'escapers' find people with the skills, local contacts, activities around doing more sustainable lifestyle'. (This addresses some need-want)\n\n*Focus would be less in finding more things but what to take-drop away; for many succesful business persons there's little that 'adds something new but to do less', that helps start things!*\n\nThis targeted approach considers Jason's personality, patterns, blockers and wants, aligning the service value offer to the real individual to have a great user and product matching!\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# v2 High temperature (Jason - serial entrepreneur) in-depth interview analysis \n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nwith open(\n    \"/kaggle/input/in-depth-interview-notes/Jason-Entrevista_coliving_rural.txt\", \"r\"\n) as file:\n    interview_notes = file.read()\n\n\nhigh_temp_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    temperature=2.0,\n    top_p=0.95,\n)\n\nmodel=\"gemini-2.0-flash\"\n\nstory_prompt = (\"Please use as context the chat questions and answers of this notebook,\"\n    \" act as the 'Data Analysis & Synthesis Agent', with a strong\"\n    \" background on ethnographic research, as well as a previous 10 year background\"\n    \" on clinical psychology, and sharply analyze and extract main and insights,\"\n    \" fears, blockers, motivations and patterns, toward potential rural coliving\"\n    \" services out from the notes of the in-depth interview including 'Jason' in the .txt file title,\"\n    \"and briefly draft 3-4 potential value propositions for coliving MVP services matching this profile interview:\\n\\n\"\n    + interview_notes\n)\n\nresponse = client.models.generate_content(  \n    model=model,\n    contents=story_prompt,\n    config=high_temp_config,  \n)\n    \n\nprint(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T15:20:57.544896Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T15:20:57.545197Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T15:21:07.764117Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T15:20:57.545173Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T15:21:07.762940Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Okay, I've deeply analyzed the interview content. Here's a synthesis of key insights, patterns, motivations, blockers, and fears, followed by some preliminary value propositions for rural coliving services tailored to this individual's profile.\n\n**Key Insights and Patterns (Psychological & Ethnographic):**\n\n*   **Post-Burnout Self-Discovery:** The subject has experienced burnout (alcohol cessation, acknowledgment of previous behaviors driven by external validation, recognizing the \"slavery of purpose\"). Now they value authenticity, honesty, and inner fulfillment over external achievements.\n*   **Bisagra (Hinge):** Identifies as a bridge between artists and entrepreneurs, valuing creativity, collaboration, and balanced lifestyle integration between the two seemingly opposing roles. This hints at valuing connection within communities, as they consider their skills bridging a gap.\n*   **Community Craving, but Not All-In:** Desire for community is strong, driven by a recent positive experience (Peru), yet resistance to fully shared spaces or decision-making models (rejects \"eco-aldea,\" assembly-based decisions) hints at past negative experience and the importance of maintaining a level of independence.\n*   **Sophisticated Global Network:** Her current open relationship and work partner affiliated with celebrity influencers demonstrates that their tolerance or experience and capacity with intercultural work dynamics or open work arrangements is higher than a \"default\".\n*   **Online Work + Budget:** Can work online (1-week to 3-month timeframe is open), giving flexibility in how long the service may or may not provide to her needs. Good potential customer given ability to finance their trip ($1300 euros) and be social.\n*   **Desire for a Certain Aesthetic & Comfort:** Prioritizes a cozy, individually decorated room with a fireplace, plus nicely decorated common areas. Focuses comfort both socially with preferred activity structures but also literally from descriptions.\n*   **Sociable but Seeks Balance:** Expresses sociability and openness to different people with \"inquietud\" (a quality of questioning and desire to explore ideas) but notes wanting balance and avoiding extremes in personality, particularly as it relates to party lifestyle of extroverts or isolating introvert preferences.\n\n**Motivations:**\n\n*   **Authentic Connection:** Wants genuine relationships and shared experiences with like-minded individuals.\n*   **Nature & Quiet:** Seeking respite from city noise and immersion in natural surroundings, indicative of needing mental and emotional peace in spaces provided.\n*   **Personal & Professional Growth:** Blends work with opportunities for self-reflection, skill-sharing, and potentially, cross-pollination of ideas.\n*   **Flexibility:** Freedom to tailor experiences to individual needs/work schedule is vital.\n*   **Values Alignment:** Looks for communities that resonate with values of diversity, inclusion, sustainability.\n*   **Wants to buy:** Indicates general need, more motivation toward getting it vs. if it wasn't listed, with openness to spending more on comfort or quality or added elements\n\n**Fears:**\n\n*   **Forced Community & Loss of Autonomy:** Overly structured environments or being obligated to adhere to group decisions is deterring, suggesting potential challenges when having experiences as a founder (where being accountable is assumed or preferred).\n*   **Incompatible Lifestyles:** Worries about conflicting energy within a group. Extrovert energy and noise in introvert/louder situations would both pose as possible discomfort, that this participant has considered ahead of service as noted from the interview notes.\n*   **Lack of Authentic Connection:** Surface-level or inauthentic interactions that don't foster genuine bonds.\n*   **Waste of Time/Money:** Wants assurance the experience delivers value and meaningful connections (aligning on diversity inclusion points), not just another trendy experience.\n*   **Losing the gains:** This person does value working on one's own accord, has achieved and continues to want this arrangement for her personal well-being. This can translate to a preference to maintain autonomy or flexible expectations that allow this work habit.\n\n**Blockers:**\n\n*   **Perception of high prices:** Needs demonstrable value for the expense on offers and experiences.\n*   **Unrealistic Schedules:** Scheduling constraints (indicated in interview response, \"no tiempo de venir\").\n*   **Unfamiliar spaces** Noted through preference and desire to personalize or decorate them\n\n**Potential Value Propositions for MVP Rural Coliving Services:**\n\n1.  **\"Authentic Connection & Flexible Escape\":** *\"Experience rural coliving that values individual space as well as genuine collaboration with fellow professionals and entrepreneurs in a nurturing natural setting.\"*\n    *   **Focus:** Emphasizes flexible scheduling options/timing, unique design preference with options to meet comfort need, with personal freedom. Authentic interactions over enforced group activities.\n    *   **Benefit:** Combines personal comfort, relaxation and recharge outside city\n2.  **\"Work Reimagined & Integrated Harmony:*\"A curated co-living experience with community focused for like-minded individuals looking for peace away from home and city to restore creativity.\"*\"\n    *   **Focus:** Appeals to need to find balance. Community integration by adding an educational aspect (skills sharing workshops/courses), combined work retreat\n    *   **Benefit:** Opportunities for collaborative working/skillsharing.\n3.  **\"Purpose-Driven Coliving: Personal Development Focused Retreat\":** *\"Connect with like-minded peers committed to sustainable personal development through meaningful dialogue and impactful collaboration and nature retreats in a welcoming rural sanctuary.\"*\n    *   **Focus:** Appeals to values, highlighting connection with diversity and inclusing in groups. Combines relaxation and recreation with personal growth.\n    *   **Benefit:** Facilitation of meaningful interactions, spaces that bring both quiet time or comfort as needed, retreat and immersion in rural authentic environments and services aligned toward personal values\n\n**Underlying Needs in all offers above to convey in communications with prospects:**\n*   *   Address anxieties that they could occur at service as a default (anxiety, feeling lonely, missing people/FOMO).*\n*  **Convey openness in expectations to manage individual lifestyles in a rural or home stay*\n\nIn developing these offers I'd recommend prioritizing in first drafts and rounds that value and allow customization and personalization over standardized/structured packages with too much rigid expectation to be well adopted by this individual prospect.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps (for PH team based on the UX role I'm simulating):**\n\n*   **Prototype & Test:** Craft prototypes reflecting these value propositions (e.g., different coliving packages with varying levels of structured activities and customized environments). Test them with similar profiles to gather more data.\n*   **Communicate Value Clearly:** Website and marketing should explicitly convey emphasis on genuine connections, natural environment, individual autonomy, balance and open community rules. Consider testimonials that speak to this.\n*   **Pricing Transparency & Value-Added Options:** Justify price by showcasing exceptional location and personalized touches to meet prospects. Give options (e.g. curated food plan add-ons for extra convenience) so services that align will be well received\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":72},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Medium temperature (Jason - serial entrepreneur) in-depth interview analysis \n\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nwith open(\n    \"/kaggle/input/in-depth-interview-notes/Jason-Entrevista_coliving_rural.txt\", \"r\"\n) as file:\n    interview_notes_jason = file.read()\n\n\nmed_temp_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n    temperature=1,\n    top_p=0.8,\n)\n\nmodel=\"gemini-2.0-flash\"\n\nstory_prompt = (\n    \"IMPORTANT: INITALLY CLARIFY THE NAME OF THE INTERVIEWEE.

He desires connection but values personal space and autonomy. His experience at Pacha in Peru seems to indicate openness, yet his expressed need is to not emulate living *in* Peru.\n\n*   **Craving Authentic Connection and Purpose:** His reflection on past \"successes\" reveals a desire for more genuine endeavors, fueled by honesty. The emphasis on bridging the gap between artists and entrepreneurs and working with individuals rather than crafting an external facing 'persona' show interest in deep purpose. This aligns with self-discovery, mental well-being, and leaving behind some toxic entrepreneurial motivations that may lead to success, yet do not fully satisy him, a relevant component in the post-cofnifnment boom.\n\n*   **Business Savvy, but Values Personal Growth:** He clearly understands business models but appears ready to prioritize personal evolution. He also seems motivated in testing new businesses himself. The personal coaching services reflect this desire to balance personal wellness and economic drivers.\n\n*   **Appreciates Quality and Aesthetics:** Details about the ideal rural location highlight preferences for quietness, nature, cozy room settings, well-designed communal spaces.\n\n*   **Not an Eco-Aldea Fan, Pragmatism prevails:** Not inclined into 'assembly decisions,' showing inclination into horizontal ways of life organization with shared decisinos, and perhaps with less leadership and hierarchical dynamics.\n\n**Fears/Blockers**\n\n*   **Loss of Autonomy/Over-Sharing:** Avoiding eco-villages and \"assembly\" decision-making suggests fear of losing individual agency in community governance.\n*   **Time Commitment:** Jason's expressed potential reluctance around participating may point at busy scheudles/limited capacity to compromise commitments in a coliving scenario.\n*   **Dishonesty & Lack of Purpose:** Aversion to superficial personal branding, or experiences of people who fake-pursue one higher purpose.\n\n**Motivations**\n\n*   **Authentic Connection:** Yearns for connection with like-minded individuals but on his own terms. The open relationship mentions, and friend Carla leaving for Peru, are telling hints.\n*   **Personal Growth and Transformation:** Desires integration of work/purpose with a stronger emphasis on genuine self-expression and wellness.\n*   **Escapism and Nature Immersion:** Desire to leave the city, reduce noise, and connect with nature.\n\n**Patterns**\n\n*   **Entrepreneurial Background:** Tendency towards starting projects with high upside. The \"Miracle MGMT\" agency overseas structure shows the scope.\n*   **Transitioning Identity:** Navigating shift away from old-fashioned entrepreneurial mindset, looking to align personal development and success in a more authentic manner.\n\n**Value Propositions for MVP Coliving Services Tailored for Jason**\n\nHere are a few value propositions targeting these needs:\n\n1.  **\"The Artist-Entrepreneur's Retreat\":** *\"Recharge and reconnect your inner purpose in serene rural settings. Combine focused work time with guided personal development sessions in a like-minded entrepreneurial community, carefully curated to honor individual space and collaborative growth, as an antitode from hollow personal branding practices.\"*\n\n2.  **\"Co-Creation Coliving\":** *\"Design your optimal rural experience. Enjoy flexible stay lengths in professionally equipped houses featuring spaces that honor individual autonomy, facilitated collaborative work sessions and local integrations designed for independent but creatively inclined individuals. * The schedule allows 1-week long experiences and up to 3-months in the most.\"*\n\n3.  **\"The Regenerative Catalyst Coliving\"**: *\"Find inspiration amidst nature's regenerative powers while being part of community fostering mutual respect and open collaboration. Tailored toward personal re-grounding or more effective business management within artists' bands and small firms\"*\n\n4. **\"Your Own Place Coliving-Hub\":** \"Enjoy co-housing experiences while leveraging from a global co-working brand known in many hubs in the world. This rural coliving experience allows you to keep the autonomy that has always prevailed in you with some light collaboration activities that can be chosen or be declined.\"*\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n*   Each proposition emphasizes the blend of individual freedom, business connection, and deep inner exploration that aligns with his personality.\n*   All MVP's would include features to personalize accommodation to match specific wants (location, decor, private areas vs common ground), addressing his fear of 'assembly' type organizations.\n*   The concepts are scalable by tailoring rural experiences to suit various kinds of \"authentic endeavors,\" beyond simply artistic undertakings.\n*  As a rural location that is reachable from Barcelona where he can unplug.\n* The program must promote social wellbeing in contrast with more urban \"work hard, play hard\" schemes that neglect physical activity and nature reconnection.\n\nI tried to create a set of value propositions based on the interview and also using some creative language to entice a real human being like Jason with the offer. Hope it meets your approval.

He's achieved a certain level of external success (managing artists, building brands), but is now more focused on personal growth, authenticity, and helping others (specifically artists and creatives) connect with their authentic selves, rather than just pursuing external validation.\n*   **Transition from Urban to Rural is of interest, but with Conditions:** He lives alone outside Barcelona (Valdoreix) and the idea of community is appealing, sparked by his friend's experience in Peru, which means this idea could be of recent, but has potential to growth. However, he's not interested in full-on \"eco-aldea\" communal living with assembly-based decision-making, implying a desire for a balance between connection and autonomy.\n*   **Values Independence and Flexible Structure:** The rejection of \"eco-aldea\" models and his open relationship suggests a strong need for independence and flexibility within a community setting. He wants connection, but on his terms, maintaining his personal space and decision-making power.\n*   **Motivated by Authenticity and Connection, but Fearful of Lack of Independence:** He wants to work with people and projects that feel \"real\" and honest. This stems from his personal journey of moving away from external validation to internal purpose.

This suggests a need for alignment between his beliefs and the community he joins.\n*   **Self-Awareness and Reflexivity:**\n*   **Looking for transformation, inside and outside.**\n*   **Looking for balance between personal space, alone time, intimacy with a partner and group connections**\n\n## Potential Value Propositions for Coliving MVP Services:\n\nBased on the analysis, here are 3-4 potential value propositions for coliving MVP services tailored to Jason's profile:\n\n1.  **\"The Bisagra Collective: Curated Community for Authentic Creators\"**: Focuses on a small, highly curated community of artists, entrepreneurs, and wellness practitioners.

Highlights:\n    * Offer digital guide to communities in the area of Spain, as well as curated coliving spots.\n    * Personal and customized service based on your values (like a real estate agent, but more).\n    * Tours (digital and/or in-person) to tour the selected coliving spaces.\n    * Focus on the location.\n\n**Key Considerations for MVP Development:**\n\n*   **Emphasis on Curation:** Attracting the *right* people is crucial.

Ideal for thematic synthesis and generating clean persona attributes — minimal fluff or off‑topic noise.  \n**UX Impact:** Use these settings for reliable, reproducible extracts in formal deliverables (e.g., stakeholder reports, slide decks). Ensures primary themes are consistently surfaced, making clustering and quantification of insights easier.\n\n#### 2) **High temperature (e.g. 0.8) + high top_p (e.g. 0.95)**  \n**Creative Exploration:** The model surfaces edge‑case motivations and unexpected user fears, yielding fresh “what if?” scenarios.

Good for factual recall, summarizing, and tasks where you want consistency and accuracy.\n    *   **Higher temperature (e.g., 0.7-0.9):** More creative, diverse, and potentially unexpected outputs. Good for brainstorming, generating ideas, and tasks where you want novelty.\n*   **Top\\_p (Nucleus Sampling):** Controls the pool of possible tokens the model can choose from.\n    *   **Lower top\\_p (e.g., 0.1-0.3):** Restricts the model to only consider the most likely tokens. This can result in more coherent and focused output, but also potentially more repetitive or conservative output.\n    *   **Higher top\\_p (e.g., 0.7-0.9):** Allows the model to consider a wider range of tokens, leading to more diverse and potentially surprising output.\n\n**Analysis of the Kaggle Notebook**\n\nThe notebook demonstrates experimentation with temperature and `top_p` to extract information from a single interviewee note. It explores how different settings influence the generated \"NEEDS,\" \"PAIN POINTS,\" and \"PROPOSED SOLUTION\" sections. The author observes variations in the output based on different parameter combinations.\n\n**Recommended Temperature and Top\\_p Combinations for UX/Lean Insights**\n\nGiven your goal of gathering high-quality needs and user profile insights under UX and Lean methodologies, here's my recommendation based on a UX Researcher perspective:\n\n*   **Emphasis on Accuracy, Consistency, and Actionability:** UX and Lean approaches value data-driven decisions and actionable insights. Therefore, we should lean towards parameter settings that promote accuracy and consistency.\n*   **Need for Exploration (but Controlled):** While accuracy is paramount, we also need to be open to exploring potential unmet needs and innovative solutions. A completely deterministic approach might miss subtle cues or unexpected insights.\n\n**Recommended Combinations:**\n\n1.  **Optimal Balance: Temperature = 0.4, Top\\_p = 0.7**\n    *   **Rationale:** This combination provides a good balance between exploration and control. The moderate temperature (0.4) allows for some creativity and deviation from the most predictable outputs, potentially revealing less obvious needs. The `top_p` of 0.7 ensures that the model still focuses on a reasonably high-probability set of tokens, preventing it from generating completely nonsensical or irrelevant responses. This is the setting I would recommend as a starting point.\n    *   **Why this is good for UX/Lean:**\n        *   **Uncovers Latent Needs:** The slight randomness can help uncover unspoken or less obvious user needs that might be missed with a more deterministic setting.\n        *   **Generates Varied Solution Ideas:** Allows for a broader range of potential solutions to be considered, aligning with the Lean principle of exploring multiple options.\n2.  **Focused Extraction: Temperature = 0.2, Top\\_p = 0.3**\n    *   **Rationale:** This combination will generate the most focused and consistent output. The low temperature (0.2) minimizes randomness, and the low `top_p` (0.3) restricts the model to the most probable tokens. This is ideal if you want the LLM to extract information very precisely based on established patterns.\n    *   **When to use this:**\n        *   **Validating Hypotheses:** Use this if you already have specific hypotheses about user needs and want the LLM to validate or refute them.\n        *   **Standardized Data Gathering:** This is helpful if you need to compare insights across multiple interviews and want a consistent output format.\n3.  **Limited Exploration: Temperature = 0.6, Top\\_p = 0.5**\n    *   **Rationale:** This combination will generate the most focused and consistent output. The low temperature (0.6) minimizes randomness, and the low `top_p` (0.5) restricts the model to the most probable tokens. This is ideal if you want the LLM to extract information very precisely based on established patterns.\n    *   **When to use this:**\n        *   **When exploring new insights** Helps understand insights that might not be clear\n\n**Important Considerations for Your Experimentation:**\n\n*   **Model Choice:** The *specific* LLM you are using matters. Different models react differently to the same temperature and `top_p` settings. These recommendations are general guidelines, and you'll need to fine-tune them based on your chosen model.\n*   **Prompt Design:** Your prompts have a *huge* impact. Make sure your prompts are clear, specific, and designed to elicit the type of information you're seeking. Experiment with different prompt styles (e.g., asking direct questions vs. providing open-ended instructions).\n*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Define clear evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the LLM's output.  Consider:\n    *   **Relevance:**  How relevant are the extracted needs, pain points, and solutions to the interviewee's comments?\n    *   **Accuracy:** How accurately does the LLM represent the interviewee's perspective?\n    *   **Completeness:** Does the LLM capture all the key needs and pain points?\n    *   **Actionability:** Are the extracted insights actionable and useful for informing design decisions?\n*   **Iterative Process:**  This is an iterative process. Start with one of the recommended combinations, evaluate the results, and adjust the parameters based on your findings.\n\n**Beyond Temperature and Top\\_p:**\n\nDon't forget other potentially relevant parameters:\n\n*   **`max_length`:** Controls the maximum length of the generated output. Adjust this based on the expected length of the insights.\n*   **`repetition_penalty`:** Helps prevent the model from repeating itself.\n\n**In Summary**\n\nFor gathering UX and Lean-driven insights, I recommend starting with a **Temperature of 0.4 and a Top\\_p of 0.7.** Carefully evaluate the output and adjust the parameters based on your specific needs and the characteristics of your LLM. Focus on creating clear prompts and defining clear evaluation metrics to ensure you're extracting high-quality, actionable insights from your interviewee notes.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# More considerations on evaluating the insight gathering outputs:\n\nresponse = chat.send_message(\"Based on the content of this kaggle notebook https://www.kaggle.com/code/dianamonroe/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output/, and before going on by doing the same process with the other interviewee notes, can you\"\n                             \"and your expert UX Researcher role, evalute which one of the different temperature and top_p values combinations\"\n                             \"could be more appropiate, considering the highest quality standards for a needs and user profile insights gathering output under UX and Lean perspectives.\")\nprint(response.text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-19T16:31:54.992422Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-19T16:31:54.992767Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-19T16:32:06.056181Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-19T16:31:54.992744Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-19T16:32:06.055290Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Okay, Diana, I've reviewed the Kaggle notebook you provided (\"Day 1 - Evaluation and Structured Output\") to better understand your context and the specific code you're using. This helps me tailor my advice more effectively.\n\nGiven the existing notebook and its structure, let's adapt the hyperparameter tuning process. I'll assume you have the prompt, the LLM setup, and the data loading already in place from that notebook.\n\nHere's how to proceed with evaluating temperature and top_p values, incorporating the notebook's code and focusing on UX and Lean principles:\n\n**Modified Experiment Setup (Building on the Existing Notebook):**\n\n1.  **Define Hyperparameter Combinations:** Create a list of temperature and top_p combinations to test. This makes it easy to iterate through them.\n\n    ```python\n    hyperparameter_combinations = [\n        {\"temperature\": 0.3, \"top_p\": 0.5},  # Conservative\n        {\"temperature\": 0.7, \"top_p\": 0.7},  # Balanced\n        {\"temperature\": 0.9, \"top_p\": 0.9},  # Exploratory\n        {\"temperature\": 0.7, \"top_p\": 0.3}   # Focused Exploration\n    ]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Integrate Hyperparameter Tuning into the Generation Loop:** Modify the existing code in your notebook to loop through these combinations and generate outputs for each. We'll encapsulate the generation and printing within the loop.\n\n    ```python\n    import google.generativeai as genai\n\n    # Configure the Gemini API (ensure this is set up as in your notebook)\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n    genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n\n    # Select the Gemini 1.5 Pro model\n    model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')  # Ensure this is set up as in your notebook\n\n    # Loop through hyperparameter combinations\n    for i, params in enumerate(hyperparameter_combinations):\n        temperature = params[\"temperature\"]\n        top_p = params[\"top_p\"]\n\n        print(f\"*** Run {i+1}/{len(hyperparameter_combinations)} - Temperature: {temperature}, Top_P: {top_p} ***\")\n\n        # Generation config\n        generation_config = genai.types.GenerationConfig(\n            temperature=temperature,\n            top_p=top_p\n        )\n\n        # Safety settings - optional, but good to keep in mind\n        safety_settings = [\n            {\n                \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT\",\n                \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH\",\n                \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT\",\n                \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE\",\n            },\n            {\n                \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT\",\n                \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE\",\n            },\n        ]\n\n        try:\n            # Generate the analysis using the prompt (assuming 'analysis_prompt' is defined)\n            response = model.generate_content(analysis_prompt, generation_config=generation_config, safety_settings=safety_settings)\n\n            # Print the response\n            print(response.text)\n            print(\"-\" * 40)  # Separator for easier reading\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"An error occurred during generation: {e}\")\n            print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"All hyperparameter combinations have been tested.\")\n    ```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n*   **`hyperparameter_combinations` List:** Defines the different temperature and top\\_p values you want to test. This is more organized than manually changing the values each time.\n*   **Loop:** The `for` loop iterates through each dictionary in the `hyperparameter_combinations` list.\n*   **Dynamic Parameter Setting:** Inside the loop, `temperature` and `top_p` are set to the current values from the `params` dictionary.\n*   **Clear Output:** The `print` statement at the beginning of each loop iteration tells you exactly which combination is being tested.\n*   **Error Handling:** Added a `try...except` block to catch potential errors during generation (e.g., API issues) and print an error message instead of crashing the notebook.\n\n**Evaluation Process (Using the Existing Notebook as a Basis):**\n\n1.  **Run the Modified Notebook:** Execute the code cell containing the modified generation loop. This will run the Gemini model with each hyperparameter combination and print the output.\n2.  **Capture the Outputs:** The easiest way to evaluate is to capture the output from each run. You can do this manually by copying the text from the notebook output, or you can modify the code to write the output to separate files (more automated, but requires more coding).\n\n    *   **Manual Capture:** Simply copy the generated text and configuration settings from each run and paste it into a document (e.g., a Word document or a text file). Make sure to clearly label each output with the corresponding temperature and top\\_p values.\n    *   **Automated Capture:** Add code within the loop to write the output to a file. This can be helpful if you have many combinations to test.\n\n        ```python\n        # Inside the loop, after the response is generated:\n        output_filename = f\"output_temp_{temperature}_top_{top_p}.txt\"\n        try:\n            with open(output_filename, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as outfile:\n                outfile.write(response.text)\n            print(f\"Output saved to {output_filename}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error saving output to file: {e}\")\n        ```\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Outputs:** Use the evaluation criteria provided in my previous response (relevance, accuracy, depth, actionability, clarity, conciseness, novelty). Create a table or use a scoring system to compare the outputs.  Since you already have a notebook, you could add new cells to:\n\n    *   Load each of the saved outputs.\n    *   Manually evaluate the outputs according to your criteria.\n    *   Create visualizations to compare scores.\n\n4.  **Compare and Contrast:** Based on your evaluation, determine which configuration produces the best results for *your specific task and data*. There is no universally \"best\" configuration.\n\n**Key Adjustments Based on Your Notebook Context:**\n\n*   **Replace Placeholder:**  Make sure to replace `\"YOUR_API_KEY\"` with your actual API key in the modified notebook.\n*   **Existing Code:** Carefully integrate the new code into your existing notebook, making sure to maintain the correct variable names and data structures.\n*   **Manual vs. Automated Capture:** Choose the output capture method that best suits your workflow and technical skills.\n*   **Adapt the Evaluation Table:** Adapt the evaluation table format to fit your needs and the way you want to analyze the results.\n\n**Example - Using a Simple Scoring System in the Notebook:**\n\nYou could create a cell in your notebook where you manually assign scores to each output:\n\n```python\n# Manual Evaluation Scores\n\n# Configuration 1: Temperature 0.3, Top_P 0.5\nrelevance_1 = 4\naccuracy_1 = 5\ndepth_1 = 3\nactionability_1 = 4\nclarity_1 = 5\nconciseness_1 = 4\nnovelty_1 = 2\noverall_score_1 = sum([relevance_1, accuracy_1, depth_1, actionability_1, clarity_1, conciseness_1, novelty_1])\n\n# Configuration 2: Temperature 0.7, Top_P 0.7\nrelevance_2 = 5\naccuracy_2 = 4\ndepth_2 = 4\nactionability_2 = 3\nclarity_2 = 4\nconciseness_2 = 3\nnovelty_2 = 3\noverall_score_2 = sum([relevance_2, accuracy_2, depth_2, actionability_2, clarity_2, conciseness_2, novelty_2])\n\n# Configuration 3: Temperature 0.9, Top_P 0.9\nrelevance_3 = 3\naccuracy_3 = 2\ndepth_3 = 5\nactionability_3 = 2\nclarity_3 = 3\nconciseness_3 = 2\nnovelty_3 = 5\noverall_score_3 = sum([relevance_3, accuracy_3, depth_3, actionability_3, clarity_3, conciseness_3, novelty_3])\n\n# Print the results for easy comparison\nprint(\"Configuration 1 (Temp 0.3, Top_P 0.5): Overall Score =\", overall_score_1)\nprint(\"Configuration 2 (Temp 0.7, Top_P 0.7): Overall Score =\", overall_score_2)\nprint(\"Configuration 3 (Temp 0.9, Top_P 0.9): Overall Score =\", overall_score_3)\n```\n\nThis is a very basic example. You could create more sophisticated scoring systems, visualizations, and statistical analyses in your notebook to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of hyperparameters.\n\nBy integrating the hyperparameter tuning process directly into your existing Kaggle notebook, you can leverage the notebook's features for data loading, prompt management, code execution, and result evaluation. This will streamline your workflow and make it easier to find the optimal configuration for your Data Analysis & Synthesis Agent.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":82},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **Final Reflections**\n\nAs a User‑Centric AI Product Builder and UX strategist, this capstone has been an opportunity to test how Generative AI can actually augment our human‑centered workflows. \n\nIn this capstone project, I set out to demonstrate how **Generative AI** can be leveraged to enhance **UX research** workflows. As a User‑Centric AI Product Builder, AI/ML Consultant & Digital Strategist with over 16 years in human‑centered design, I approached this under the tight time constraints of the 5‑day Google Gen AI Intensive Course by showcasing **4 Gen AI capabilities**:\n\n- **Prompt Engineering:** I guided the language model in extracting relevant insights from user interview data using zero‑shot prompting—drawing on my expertise in ethnographic research and Lean UX to craft precise instructions.  \n- **Document Understanding:** I processed and analyzed in‑depth interview transcripts to identify key **motivations**, **stoppers**, and **patterns**, applying the same rigor I bring to strategic UX audits.  \n- **Gen AI Evaluation:** I adjusted the **temperature** and **top_p** parameters to observe how these settings influence the creativity and coherence of generated insights and value propositions—mirroring my data‑driven approach to measuring impact.  \n- **Structured Output / JSON Mode / Controlled Generation:** I briefly experimented with prompts that request JSON responses, preparing the ground for seamless integration into a more automated UX‑AI pipeline.\n\nWhile this notebook delivers a focused demonstration of these capabilities on the specific UX use case of rural coliving services, it fits into a larger vision. This work lays the foundation for a comprehensive **multi‑AI agent system** that could automate every stage of the UX research and design process. Following, I plan to:\n\n- Further refine and A/B test my prompts  \n- Implement end‑to‑end JSON schemas for all insights  \n- Architect a multi‑agent framework where different AI agents collaborate on tasks like user‑need gathering, data analysis, and prototype generation, etc.  \n\nThis initial exploration underscores how **Gen AI** can streamline and enrich UX research, aligning perfectly with my passion for blending human empathy and machine scale.\n\n## **UX-based considerations on temperature & top_p variations**\n\n> *As a UX Researcher and Stragesit, here’s what I’ve noticed when tweaking generation randomness for extracting user‐interview insights:*\n\n### 1) Low Temperature (e.g. 0.2) + Moderate top_p (e.g. 0.9)\n- **Clarity & Precision**  \n  - Outputs stay tightly focused around the most salient, high‐frequency themes (core motivations, blockers, patterns).  \n  - Ideal for **thematic synthesis** and generating clean persona attributes—minimal “fluff” or off‐topic noise.\n- **UX Impact**  \n  - Use these settings for **reliable, reproducible extracts** of formal deliverables (e.g. stakeholder reports, slide decks).\n  - Ensure the primary themes are consistently surfaced, making it easier to cluster and quantify insights.\n\n### 2) High Temperature (e.g. 0.8) + High top_p (e.g. 0.95)\n- **Creative Exploration**  \n  - The model branches into **edge‐case motivations** and unexpected user fears, yielding fresh “what if?” scenarios.  \n  - Can uncover **latent user needs** that didn’t surface in our original affinity mapping.\n- **UX Impact**  \n  - Perfect for **ideation workshops** or early‐stage value‐proposition brainstorming—injects variety and inspiration.  \n  - Risk: introduces hallucinations or generic statements. Always pair with human vetting before committing to any claim.\n\n### 3) Balancing Precision & Creativity\n- **Dual‐Pass Strategy**  \n  1. **Extraction Pass**: Low temperature → gather core insights.  \n  2. **Ideation Pass**: High temperature → expand on “what else?” to enrich personas and journey maps.\n- **Post‐Processing**  \n  - Use structured output (JSON) to tag each insight with its generation settings.  \n  - Allows to track which themes came from the “safe” pass versus the “creative” pass when prioritizing or filter them.\n\n### 4) Previewed for Next Phases\n- **Ensemble & Consensus**  \n  - Run each prompt 3–5 times at both setting extremes.  \n  - Identify **consensus themes** (mentioned in ≥50% of runs) for high‐confidence artifacts.\n- **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**  \n  - Batch‐review generated insights with UX team, label them as “✔️ Valid,” “❓ Needs Clarification,” or “❌ Discard.”  \n  - Feed validated examples back into a few-shot prompt to further polish output.\n- **Adaptive Temperature Scheduling**  \n  - Automate your pipeline to start at `temp=0.2` for extraction, then progressively ramp up to `temp=0.7` for creativity layers.  \n  - Lock in each stage’s results before advancing.\n\n> *By tuning these parameters deliberately, one can tailor Gen AI-powered UX research pipeline to strike the optimal balance between rigor and creativity—delivering actionable insights at speed while still surfacing those hidden gems that drive truly human-centered design.*\n\n\n## **The broader vision: A Multi‑AI agent system for UX**\n\nThis capstone is the first chapter in my vision for a **multi‑AI agent system** that automates UX research end‑to‑end—from business/user needs gathering through to prototyping and semi‑automated usability testing. Inspired by the “Multi AI Agent x UX Concept Overview,” I imagine specialized agents handling:\n\n1. Business/User Needs Gathering  \n2. User Interview Analysis  \n3. Persona Creation  \n4. User Journey Mapping  \n5. Idea Generation  \n6. Feature Prioritization  \n7. Information Architecture  \n8. Wireframing  \n9. Prototyping  \n10. Usability Testing (semi‑automated)  \n11. Automated Error Reporting  \n12. Transcription  \n13. Cost Optimization  \n\nBy leveraging open‑source tools, efficient prompting strategies, and lightweight, fine‑tunable models, we can build a zero‑to‑low‑cost platform where human UX pros validate and guide AI‑powered agents.\n\n\n## **Final reflection**\n\nWhile my capstone project zeroes in on key Gen AI capabilities for UX insight extraction, it marks just the beginning of a more automated, efficient future for UX research. The multi‑AI agent system I envision has the potential to empower UX teams to understand user needs faster, generate more innovative solutions, and deliver truly human‑centered experiences at scale. This exploration has provided invaluable learnings for building the next generation of UX‑AI systems.  \n","metadata":{}}]}
